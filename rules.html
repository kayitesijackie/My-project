            <p>Although those playing Mancala traditionally use a wooden board, this video shows two African children playing Mancala on the streets of their village without a board, as the game can be just as easily played using stones and by making holes in the ground.</p>
            <p>After you've seen the video why not check out our instructions page for playing Mancala, download a version of the game or play online.</p>

            <h2> How to play Ayo Game</h2>
            <p>Whilst Ayo is often played with a board, and great care is taken to craft a board with its twelve carved out circular pockets and often elaborate carvings on its sides.</p>

            <p>Ayo can also be played by simply marking out two rows of six pits in the ground, making the game more accessible to poorer people, especially children who can then simply play anywhere with sand or soft ground and a handful of stones or pebbles for playing pieces.  </p>

            <p>This short video shows how two kids playing Ayo / Awale.</p>

           		<p>Firstly you throw the sticks and for every stick that lands facing upwards you can make one step around the board. (There are four sticks, if, however none land facing up, you can make five moves.)</p>

           		<p>After the number of moves have been established you can start moving your pieces and each piece can move to an empty square or a square occupied by an opponent piece, in this case the two pieces switch positions. When two pieces of a player are adjacent to each other, those two pieces are safe and cannot be swapped. When 3 pieces are adjacent to each other, the pieces of another player cannot pass through them.</p>

           		<p>The last 5 squares are special squares, a piece is always safe on a safe square and will not be swapped, the fourth last square is the water square, when a piece lands on it, it must start from the beginning again. An exact throw is needed to leave the board.</p>
