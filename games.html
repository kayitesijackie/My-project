              <p>The name <em><span style="color: blue"><strong>Mancala</strong></span></em> is a rough translation of the Arabic 'to move' which is exactly what's involved when playing the traditional African game of Mancala.</p>
              <h2>Ayo Game</h2>
              <p><em><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ayo</strong></span></em> is played by two people, facing each other, over two rows of six pockets, or holes in the ground. Each player places four seeds or stones in each of their six pockets and the players then take turns of picking up all of the pieces from one of the pockets and dropping one of them into another pocket one by one.</p>

              <p>Ayo Game is a board game play all over Africa and some parts of Asia, America and the Caribbean. Its is a strategy board game and and the rules are not uniform in all the countries where its played. The first version of this game developed by bonako is based on two forms of game play- Pia and Seca â€“ that is popular in Cape Verde Islands.</p>
              <h2>Senet Game</h2>
              <p><em><span style="color: blue"><strong>Senet</strong></span></em> is believed to be one of the world's oldest board games and pictures of ancient Egyptians have been found playing it such as the one discovered in the tomb of Queen Nefertari, the queen of Ramesses II. Whilst the game has survived to the modern day, and has been recreated here in a flash format, the actual rules are unknown as, if they ever were written down, they have been lost in time.</p>
              <img src="http://www.africa-games.com/images/how_to_play_senet.jpg">
              <p>Despite this, rules have emerged which reflect what those rules probably were. Essentially Senet is a board game where each player has five pieces on a ten by three piece board and the aim of the game is to remove all of your pieces off the board.
