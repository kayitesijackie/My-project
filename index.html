              <p>Africa games, especially board games, have been in existence for thousands of years, and many of the games were unearthed by archaeologists, although rarely were there accompanying instructions. Some of these Africa games have been captured in paintings such as one found in the tomb of Queen Nefertari showing her playing Senet, possibly the world's oldest board game and similar to modern day backgammon. Morabaraba is another of the popular Africa games with 12 Mens Morris being its closest modern day equivalent. The game of checkers finds its roots in the ancient north Africa game of Zamma, whilst a version called Fanorona has long held popularity in Madagascar.</p>

              <p>Board games have been played in Africa for thousands of years and you can find information about ten of them in the list below. One of the oldest known board games in the world is Senet from Egypt. Unfortunately, no one wrote down the rules, so historians have had to make them up. Many of Africa's traditional board games can be played using materials found in nature. Seeds and stones make perfect game pieces, and boards can be scratched into the dirt, dug out of the ground, or drawn on a piece of paper. â€‹Mancala is an African board game that is played worldwide, there are in fact hundreds of versions played in Africa.</p>
